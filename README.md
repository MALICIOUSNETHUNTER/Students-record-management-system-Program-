This is a menu-driven C program to manage student records using singly linked lists. The program allows users to perform common operations such as creating a list of students, displaying records, counting entries, searching for a student by roll number, adding or deleting records at various positions, and reversing the list.

It demonstrates practical use of dynamic memory allocation, structures, pointers, and linked list manipulation, making it a solid project for learning fundamental data structures in C.
